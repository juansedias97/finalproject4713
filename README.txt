Hello professor,

For the final project here I have attached the entire web app fully functional locally and also deployed.
The files inside the folder "finalproject4713" are the main app called "main.py" along with 2 other additional
folders one to set up the environment in python and the other one to store the files necessary for the web app.

Inside the "website" folder you will find:
		* a static folder with 2 videos and the image used in the main page
		*a template folder with 5 html files for all the pages and based design of the web app
		*3 additional python files to take care of the init, auth, and views back end of the webapp


The website's link that has been deployed is the following:
		http://finalproject4713.herokuapp.com/
The password/code is:
		123
The github repository to the same files attached is:
		https://github.com/juansedias97/finalproject4713

NOTE: ---------------------------------------------------------------
	The current link to ngrok inside the "stream.html" file is 
	not currently working, link needs to be updated every time 
	the session ends. With this being said the day of the presen-
	tation I will update the working live stream link to demons-
	trate the live camera working
